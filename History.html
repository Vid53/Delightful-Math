      Creation Story
      
    </h3>
    <p>
      This project was created by a student for a computer science class in early 2021. It uses CSS for the aesthetic aspects, HTML for the structural aspects, and Javascript to enhance the experience of the users. Specifically, it adds interactive calculations and answer checking, which makes mathematics more enjoyable and easier to learn.

    <p>
      Note that some problems may not have links to their associated pages, because these have not been created yet. In terms of answer format, the program does not recognize ratios as the same as their integer counterparts, so answers should be entered in simplified form as integers. (E.g write 1 instead of 5/5.) All answers should be entered as integers or rounded decimals, if asked.
