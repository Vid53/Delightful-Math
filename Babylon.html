    Babylonian Rectangle Method
  </h3>
  <p>
   The Babylonians had an interesting algorithm to find the length and the width of a rectangle if you knew the sum of the length and width and the area of the rectangle:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Take half of the sum of your length and width.</li>
    <li>Square this result.</li>
    <li>Subtract the area of the rectangle from this.</li>
    <li>Take the square root.</li>
    <li>Subtract this from the half-sum of the length and width to get one side, and add it to the half-sum of the length and width to get the other side.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Try some values below to see the algorithm in action!
  </p>
  <script>
    function calculatelw()
{
        sum = document.getElementById("firstNumber").value;
        product= document.getElementById("secondNumber").value;
        half_sum=sum/2.0
        square_half_sum=half_sum**2.0
        new_thing=square_half_sum-product
        new_new_thing=new_thing**0.5
        length=half_sum-new_new_thing
        width=half_sum+new_new_thing

        document.getElementById("length").innerHTML = length
        document.getElementById("width").innerHTML=width

}

  </script>
  <form>
    Sum of Length and Width : <input type="text" id="firstNumber" /><br>
    Area of Rectangle: <input type="text" id="secondNumber" /><br>
<input type="button" onClick="calculatelw()" Value="Calculate (l,w)" />
</form>
<p>The length is : <br>
<span id = "length" ></span>
<p>The width is : <br>
<span id = "width" ></span>
</p>
<p>So how exactly does the algorithm work? If we let the width and length be w and l respectively and simplify our algorithm, we can figure it out. </p>
<p>
  We know two things:
  w+l
  and
  wl
  (the area is width times length, so this is equivalent to the expression wl.)
  <ol>
  <li>The first instruction says "take half the sum." That's:
  (w+l)/2</li>
  <li>The second says:"square this result". That simplifies to:
  (w^2+2wl+l^2)/4</li>
  <li>Then the third says: "subtract the area of the rectangle from this:
  (w^2+2wl+l^2)/4-wl
  =
  (w^2+2wl+l^2)/4-(4wl)/4
  =
  (w^2-2wl+l^2)/4</li>
  <li>Now it tells us to take the square root:
  The square root of the denominator is 2. The square root of the numerator, we might recognize, is (w-l).
  So now we've got:
  (w-l)/2</li>
  <li>Now it says we can subtract this expression from the half-sum of l,w to get one side and add it to the half-sum of l,w to get the other.</li>
  <li>
    These two simplify to: (w-l)/2-(w+l)/2=2l/2=l. The length! And (w-l)/2+(w+l)/2=2w/2=w. The width!
  </ol>
  <p>
    So the algorithm is just a set of clever manipulations, (you might have caught the difference of squares!), in the form of a well crafted recipe. The Babylonians couldn't have known this easily, of course. Assigning variables to values was a virtually unheard of concept at the time, as Algebra would take a while to make its grand entry into the world of mathematics.
