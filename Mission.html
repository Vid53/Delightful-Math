      Mission Statement
    </h3>
    <p>
      Math can be pretty darn fun sometimes! It's a fallacy that exciting mathematics is outside the purview of a basic education. In fact, math at the middle school level can be pretty entertaining. Delightful Mathematics boasts a selection of many riddles and problems that reflect the beauty of mathematics, at elementary levels and beyond. </p>
      <p>With a basic interactive platform, at Delightful Mathematics it is hoped that users of various backgrounds will find themselves enlightened and excited by the various problems and the opportunity to see them in action for themselves.</p>
